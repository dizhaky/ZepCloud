## üéØ RECOMMENDATION

## To achieve 100% cost elimination:

1. **Delete remaining Azure services** (Storage + Cognitive)
2. **Implement local alternatives** for search functionality
3. **Update project configuration** to remove Azure dependencies
4. **Test functionality** with local solutions

## Total potential savings: $599-$1,213/month ($7,188-$14,556/year)

## üìû IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

Would you like me to:

1. **Delete the remaining Azure services** (Storage + Cognitive)?
2. **Delete the entire resource group** (removes everything)?
3. **Keep the remaining services** and just stop here?

**Current Status:** Azure AI Search costs eliminated ‚úÖ
**Remaining:** $6-$22/month in other Azure services
