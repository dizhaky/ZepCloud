## 📊 COST COMPARISON BREAKDOWN

### **Regular Storage vs AI Search:**

| Service                | Cost per GB/Month | Your 300GB Cost | What You Get                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Azure Blob Storage** | $0.0184           | **$5.52/month** | Just storage                   |
| **Azure AI Search**    | $2.30             | **$690/month**  | Storage + AI Search + Indexing |

## Difference: 125x more expensive!

## 🎯 WHY AI SEARCH COSTS SO MUCH

### **1. Full-Text Indexing (Major Cost Driver)**

```

Your Documents → AI Search Processing → Searchable Index
1.2M documents × 300KB each = 360GB raw data
AI Search creates indexes = 360GB × 2-3x = 720GB-1TB indexed data

```

### **2. Vector Embeddings (AI Processing)**

```

Each document → AI analysis → Vector embedding
1.2M documents × 1,536 dimensions = Massive vector database
This enables semantic search (finding meaning, not just keywords)

```

### **3. Advanced Query Processing**

```

User Query → AI Search Engine → Results

- Semantic understanding
- Relevance scoring
- Multi-language support
- Typo tolerance
- Context awareness

```

### **4. Real-Time Capabilities**

```

- Sub-second search across 1.2M documents
- Complex queries with filters
- Faceted search
- Auto-complete
- Suggestions

```

## 🔍 DETAILED COST BREAKDOWN

### **Your Data Volume:**

- **Documents:** 1,187,916 estimated
- **Average Size:** 300KB per document
- **Raw Data:** 360GB
- **Indexed Data:** 720GB-1TB (2-3x expansion for indexing)

### **Azure AI Search Pricing:**

- **Base Cost:** $75/month (Basic tier)
- **Storage Cost:** $2.30/GB/month for data over 2GB
- **Your Cost:** $75 + (720GB-1TB × $2.30) = $1,656-$2,300/month

### **Why So Much Data?**

1. **Original Documents:** 360GB
2. **Search Indexes:** +360GB (full-text indexes)
3. **Vector Embeddings:** +360GB (AI embeddings)
4. **Metadata:** +50GB (extracted properties)
5. **Total:** 1,130GB-1,430GB

## 🎯 COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### **1. Reduce Data Volume (30-50% savings)**

- **Date Filtering:** Only last 2 years (saves 30-50%)
- **Size Filtering:** Skip >50MB files (saves 5-10%)
- **Deduplication:** Remove duplicates (saves 15-30%)

### **2. Content Optimization (40-60% savings)**

- **Text Extraction:** Store only text, not full documents
- **Compression:** Reduce storage footprint
- **Metadata-Only:** For images, store only metadata + OCR text

### **3. Tier Optimization**

- **Basic Tier:** $75 + $2.30/GB (current choice)
- **Standard S1:** $250 + $2.30/GB (includes more indexing quota)
- **Standard S2:** $1,000 + $2.30/GB (for very large datasets)

## 📊 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

### **Option 1: Hybrid Approach**

- **Store documents in Blob Storage:** $5-10/month
- **Use AI Search for indexing only:** $200-400/month
- **Total:** $205-410/month (60-70% savings)

### **Option 2: Phased Implementation**

- **Start with high-priority sites:** 20% of data
- **Cost:** $120-240/month
- **Expand gradually:** As budget allows

### **Option 3: External Search Solutions**
